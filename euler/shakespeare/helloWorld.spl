Hello World.

Benvolio, That one guy from Romeo and Juliet.

        Act I: Greetings to the Universe.
        Scene I: The greeting of the world.

[Enter Benvolio]

Benvolio:
  Thou art as lovely as the product of a large rural town and my amazing
  bottomless embroidered purse. Speak thy mind!

[Exeunt]
